I can definitely help you with the design of the affiliate marketing platform. To get started, let's outline the main components of the platform:

1. Users: This will be the main entity in your platform. Users will be able to create campaigns, add banners.
2. Banners: Banners will be the main content of your platform. They will be used in campaigns and can be of different types (image, HTML, text). Each banner will have its own performance metrics (impressions, clicks,cost per click, cost per impression,leads, conversions).
3. Campaigns: Campaigns will be the container for multiple banners. Users will be able to create and manage campaigns. Campaigns will have their own performance metrics (impressions, clicks) and can be used to track the performance of banners.
5. Tracking: Tracking will be used to track the performance of the platform. It will include tracking links, clicks, and impressions.
6. Performance Metrics: Performance metrics will be used to track the performance of the platform. They will include impressions, clicks, cost per click, cost per impression, leads, and conversions.



let me know if you can help me with the design of the platform. i chose go fiber and ent orm  for the backend.
I can definitely help you with the design of the platform using Go Fiber and Ent ORM. Here's a high-level overview of how you can structure your database and implement the features:
1. Database Structure: You can use Ent ORM to define your database schema. You'll need to create entities for Users, Banners, Campaigns, and User Banners. Each entity will have its own fields and relationships.
2. User Entity: The User entity will have fields for name, email, password, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Campaigns.
3. Banner Entity: The Banner entity will have fields for type (image, HTML, text), content, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Campaigns.
4. Campaign Entity: The Campaign entity will have fields for name, description, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Banners.
5. User Banner Entity: The User Banner entity will have fields for user ID, banner ID, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Banners.
6. Tracking Entity: The Tracking entity will have fields for user ID, banner ID, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Banners.
7. Performance Metrics Entity: The Performance Metrics entity will have fields for impressions, clicks, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Banners.
8. Styling Options Entity: The Styling Options entity will have fields for color, font, and any other relevant information. It will also have a one-to-many relationship with Banners.
9. Implementing Features: You can use Go Fiber to implement the features of your platform. You can create endpoints for creating and managing users, banners, campaigns, and user banners. You can also create endpoints for tracking performance metrics and styling options.

define the api endpoints for the platform. Here are some example API endpoints for the platform:
1. Create a new user: POST /users
2. Get all users: GET /users
3. Get a user by ID: GET /users/{id}
4. Create a new banner: POST /banners
5. Get all banners: GET /banners
6. Get a banner by ID: GET /banners/{id}
7. Create a new campaign: POST /campaigns
8. Get all campaigns: GET /campaigns
9. Get a campaign by ID: GET /campaigns/{id}
10. Create a new user banner: POST /user-banners
11. Get all user banners: GET /user-banners
